#ADR-001: Architecture Choice

##Title: Architecture choice – Modular FastAPI with PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch

We needed a lightweight yet scalable API architecture for managing books and bike rentals.

##Decision:
We chose a modular monolith using FastAPI as the core framework, with:
- PostgreSQL for transactional persistence (books, rentals)
- Elasticsearch for advanced search and analytics
- Prometheus for monitoring
- Nginx as a reverse proxy
- Docker Compose for local orchestration
